A dashboard project to learn about fetching data using React and SWR as well as motion graphics on the web. It displays non interactive elements and charts for various APIs such as weather and news. A list of APIs can be found below. It was inspired by user interfaces from movies like Tron: Legacy and Oblivion.

I add on to this project every few weeks and it will likely never be entirely complete. I have not decided what to put in the last spot on the grid so any ideas are welcome.

## Try it yourself
This may not work perfectly and i will also not provide any support.

You will need API keys from:
- Open weather map
- Alpha vantage
- News API
- Twitter

Note that some of the APIs need a paid subscription to work outside of localhost.

Clone the repo and create your own `.env` file in the root directory with these key values:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API_KEY="<your_key>"`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STOCK_API_KEY="<your_key>"`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NEWS_API_KEY="<your_key>"`
- `TWITTER_TOKEN="<your_key>"`
